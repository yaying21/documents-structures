         <p>The Beginning</p>

            1
            
            In the
            beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
            
            2
            
            Now the
            earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the
            Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

            Au
            commencement, Dieu créa le ciel et la terre. 
            
            2
            
            Or, la
            terre était chaotique et vide. Les ténèbres couvraient
            l’abîme, et l’Esprit de Dieu planait au-dessus des eaux.

            And God
            said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
            
            4
            
            God saw
            that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
            
            5
            
            God called
            the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And
            there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

            Dieu vit

            And God
            said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from
            water.” 
            
            7
            
            So God
            made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And
            it was so. 
            
            8
            
            God called
            the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the
            second day.

            And God
            said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry
            ground appear.” And it was so. 
            
            10
            
            God
            called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called
            “seas.” And God saw that it was good.

            Puis Dieu
            dit : Qu’il y ait une étendue entre les eaux pour les

            Then God
            said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the
            land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And
            it was so. 
            
            12
            
            The land
            produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing
            fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
            
            13
            
            And
            there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

            7
            
            Dieu fit
            l’étendue. Il sépara les eaux qui étaient sous
            l’étendue des eaux qui étaient au-dessus. Et ce fut
            ainsi.

            14
            
            And God
            said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from
            the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 
            
            15
            
            and let
            them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was
            so. 
            
            16
            
            God made
            two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to
            govern the night. He also made the stars. 
            
            17
            
            God set
            them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 
            
            18
            
            to
            govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that
            it was good. 
            
            19
            
            And
            there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

            il y eut un matin : ce fut le deuxième jour.

            And God
            said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the
            earth across the vault of the sky.” 
            
            21
            
            So God
            created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water
            teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird
            according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
            
            22
            
            God
            blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water
            in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 
            
            23
            
            And
            there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

            livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each
            according to its kind.” And it was so. 
            
            25
            
            God made

            rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all
