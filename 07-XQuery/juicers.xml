        <description>There&apos;s just no substitute for a properly squeezed orange in the morning.
            So delicate and refreshing. The finest hotels use mechanical juicers of this type for
            their most discriminating guests. This is the largest selling juicer of its kind.
            It&apos;s a beautiful little all-metal piece in baked enamel and polished chrome; it
            even won the Frankfurt Fair Award for its design. Uses no electricity and produces no
            non-recyclable waste as do frozen juices.</description>

        <description>The Champion Juicer is the answer to every juicing problem. Because it operates
            on the mastication process principle, the Champion chews the fibers and breaks up the
            cells of vegetables and fruits. This give you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins and trace
            minerals. The juice will be a darker, richer color, with a sweeter, richer more
            full-bodied flavor. </description>

        <description>You are not What You Eat, But What you Absorb. The rate of absorption of juice
            has never been considered a factor in comparing juicers. With the introduction of Green
            Power&apos;s magnetic Twin Gear press, this has now changed. Experiments conducted by
            the Green Power Co. Research and Development Dept. show the rate of absorption of green
            juice using dual gear extraction is up to five times greater than using centrifugal
            extraction.</description>

        <description>Wheatgrass juice contains 70% "crude" chlorophyll. Chlorophyll by definition
            being the green pigment in plants. It is considered the "blood" of plants, due to the
            similarity to our blood in molecular structure. This juicer extracts the juice out of
            the blades of wheatgrass. Normal fruit and vegetable juicers will not juice
            wheatgrass</description>
